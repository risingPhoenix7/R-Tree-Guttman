You need to implement the R-tree data structure with its insertion operation and all its allied operations such as node split, updating MBRs, etc. that are explained in the paper. You can also read at the artile "R-tree with examples" to get better understanding of the method. You can choose the "quadratic split" for node splits. You don't need to implement the deletion operation. Build the R-tree over the dataset given in data.txt. You can do this by repeated insertion of data points present in data.txt. This file consists of 21 two-dimensional data points, one point per line. You can choose the R-tree parameters as m=2 and M=4.

Then implement a pre order traveral of the tree you have build which prints the MBR values (top right point and bottom left point of the MBR being printed) for each internal node traversed, and prints the 2-D objects stored in them while traversing the leaf nodes. Clear distinction is to be made while printing, whether the node you are printing is internal node or external node.
